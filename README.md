# Mongo-Scraper 

Use this site to save articles, and make notes from Digg.com.

I used mongoose to store articles and notes in a mongo database. Axios and Cheerio was used to scrape the site for articles.
I used bootstrap to style the pages and handlebars to create dynamic content for pages.  
My site runs using heroku https://mongo-scraper-clong6.herokuapp.com/.
